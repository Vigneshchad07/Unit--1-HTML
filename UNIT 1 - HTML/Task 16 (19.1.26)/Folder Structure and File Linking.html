  <h2>Welcome to the Project Home Page</h2>
  <p>This page (index.html) demonstrates linking between files using a clear folder structure:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="About.html">About Page</a>
      <br><small>(File: about.html – located in the ProjectRoot folder)</small>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="Doc.html">Docs: Info</a>
      <br><small>(File: info.html – located in the docs folder)</small>
    </li>
  <p>
    The <strong>about.html</strong> and <strong>docs/info.html</strong> files should also contain navigation links back to this page and to each other, following relative file paths according to the folder structure.
  </p>
